# LochStudios Daily Scripts

This repository is all the scripts that I use when deploying a new server and need it up and running from boot up, I've made this public because I know the hassle of trying to get servers up and running.

If you need a script here or you think you have a script that may help others or you have a bug to report, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LochStudios/Ubuntu-16-04-Scripts/issues)!
